- We took out the bold lines around the keys and display to make it look more aesthetically pleasing.
- Added a mostly non-functional keyboard below the Wordle display
  - It includes a functional reset button that works to restart the game at any time.
  - Changes color (white, grey, yellow, and green) based on the respective color change on the wordle display/if the reset button is pressed.
  - The delete key is not functional, only there for design purposes.
- Game messages (for winning, losing, or not being a word) are displayed on the screen. The messages appear in the position of the Wordle logo and go away with user input.
- Initially we intended to use "char" for our letters, but we found it much easier to use "String" instead.
  - The correct word displays in the Wordle logo if all 6 attempts to solve the word are incorrect.
- The "Keys" class became "Grid", within this class, however, the keyboard is set up.  
  - Added different instance variables to correlate with the class: numRows, numCols, margin_x, margin_y, top_margin.
