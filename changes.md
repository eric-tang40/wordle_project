- Added a mostly non-functional keyboard below the Wordle display
  - It includes a functional reset button that works to restart the game at any time.
  - Changes color (white, grey, yellow, and green) based on the respective color change on the wordle display/if the reset button is pressed.
  - The delete key is not functional, only there for design purposes.
- Game messages (for winning, losing, or not being a word) are displayed on the screen. The messages appear in the position of the Wordle logo and go away with user input.
