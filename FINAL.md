### How To Play

- The game is played by typing a five letter word into the display. Each letter goes into one box in the row the player is on.
- The player then presses **ENTER**; if the word is in the accepted word list, the player can go onto their second attempt. If not, the player has to backspace and choose another word.
- The boxes of the previous row will now change color according to what the player has inputted. If the letter does not appear in the final word, then the box will turn grey. If the letter appears in the final word but is in the wrong location, the box will turn yellow. If the letter appears in the final word and it is in the right location, the box will turn green.
